# RoboTech 2023
## Mental Health
Medicines have evolved and changed for thousands of years, yet only one has remained the same. Laughter has proved itself time and time again, always putting a smile on
people's faces and making them feel better. We decided to approach the Mental Health theme of RoboTech with the idea that laughter is the best medicine. 

Multiple research studies prove how laughter helps a person's mental and physical well-being. It has been determined that laughter increases the endorphins released by
your brain, increases heart and blood rates, and helps in muscle relaxation; all of which reduce stress levels. Laughter also benefits a person's physical health,
lowering the risk of or helping fight illnesses such as coronary heart disease, Parkinson's disease, and rheumatoid arthritis.


## About our Project - HumorAI
Our project is a Windows Application that generates a joke on the screen based on the options selected. The user can select what type of joke they would not want to see from a list of six options. Additionally, they can utilize VR to create immersive therapeutic environments for individuals struggling with mental health issues. By incorporating humor and laughter into these environments, users may experience reduced stress, anxiety, and depression. 

The technologies, skills, and languages used in this project are:
- Humor API
- Microsoft Azure Speech SDK
- Text-to-Speech AI
- Unity (VR and Game Development)
- C#
