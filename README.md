# RoboTech 2023
## Mental Health
Medicines have evolved and changed for thousands of years, yet only one has always remained the same. Laughter has proved itself time and time again, never 
failing to put a smile on people's faces and making them feel better. So, we decided to approach the Mental Health theme of RoboTech with the idea that 
laughter is the best medicine. 

There are multiple research studies that prove how laughter helps a person's mental and physical wellbeing. It is determined that laughter increases the 
endorphins that are released by your brain, increases heart and blood rates, and helps in muscle relaxation; all of which reduce stress levels. Laughter 
also benefits a person's physical health, lowering the risk of or helping fight illnesses such as coronary heart disease, Parkinsons disease, and rheumatoid 
arthritis.

## About our Project - HumorAI
Our project is a Windows Application that generates a joke on the screen, and allows the mentally fucked user to choose a celebrity from a dropdown list 
to voice the joke that is on the screen. VR can be used to create immersive therapeutic environments for individuals struggling with mental health issues. 
By incorporating humor and laughter into these environments, users may experience a reduction in stress, anxiety, and depression. 

The technologies, skills, and languages used in this project are:
- APIs
- Text-to-Speech AI
- Unity
- C#
